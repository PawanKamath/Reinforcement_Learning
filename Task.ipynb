This is because, stack agent allows us to train the agent for **n** environments per step. This will make the actions that are passed to the environment as a n dimensional vector. This will reinforce the agent with better accuracy and speed. Where as the single agent will be trained on just one environment per step which is the reason for it's decreased accuracy than stack agent for a given total_timestep."
